Welcome to my blog!
I'm Weiyi He, a Ph.D. student at Michigan State University, majoring in Statistics. I created this blog to share my knowledge and ideas, and I'm excited to connect with people from various fields.

Prior to MSU, I received a B.S. in Statistics from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), where I wrote my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Professor Yaning Yang.
